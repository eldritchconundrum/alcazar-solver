Learning haskell by writing a solver for Alcazar.

Alcazar is a game based on finding hamiltonian paths in rectangle grids with walls. The rules are simple:
1. Enter from one door, exit from another
2. Cross every space exactly once
3. Each puzzle has a unique solution

This solver searches for the solution with simple steps that a human would use, by gradually deducing the paths that are in the solution. Rule #3 is not exploited.

# How to use

There is no GUI to draw the levels. Maybe I will create one someday. Maybe not. I wouldn't count on it. Don't judge me! >_<

I wasn't paid for this. Honestly I'm just writing this README because github sort of shamed me into doing it. "Help people interested in this repository understand your project by adding a README.", they said. As if the "project" was supposed to be always in a clean, finished state, ready to be scrutinized, forked, and contributed to by others.

Well I say: No! This is my project, I'm having fun all alone here, thank you very much, and I won't explain you how to use it. When I'm bored in the evenings, once in a while, I will go back to it and tweak the code a little. And then I'll use a deliberately useless commit message.

You know what? Commit messages are absolutely mandatory for code quality on the long run. They provide context to the history, they store related issue informations, and I'd never change anything in someone else's code without leaving a commit message. And branches! Branches are so great too. But guess what. I don't need any of those things. I'm just practicing my haskell with a small project that no one uses. I will never ever correct a bug in a past version of the code. Because only one person on earth ever uses it, it's me, and I always use the latest version. So the past can burn in a fire. I use github because I'm also learning to use github, not because I need it.

So stop guilt-tripping me, github. Thanks.

Where was I... Yeah, so, how to use: run interpreter, read the code and figure it out. I trust you. Especially if you are me. Heck, I would even trust future me on this.
